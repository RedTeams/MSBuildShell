### MSBuildShell, a Powershell Host running within MSBuild.exe

This code let's you Bypass Application Whitelisting and Powershell.exe restrictions and gives you a shell that almost looks and feels like a normal Powershell session (Get-Credential, PSSessions -> Works, Tab Completion -> Unfortunately not).
It will also bypass the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), which provides enhanced malware protection for Powershell scripts.
